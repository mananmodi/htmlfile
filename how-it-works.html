                    <h4 class="subTitle">How does this sound? Raise risk free marketing budget and have your album promoted by potentially 1000's of fans incentivised to make you a success. Sound good? Read on</h4>
                    <p>We don't cast dispession on any music. But we think it is fair to say that the music scene today is awash with commercialised music, promoted to the masses. There is a market for that sort of music, otherwise it wouldn't be popular.</p>
                    <p>The problem is that 'real' artists… well, they just do not want that type of exposure. Real music is about songwriting, a unique style, songs that people connect with. It's not about having anything about you, or only having a great voice.</p>
                    <p>Our fans are heavily incentivised to make you a success. They will <a href="#">discover</a> you, <a href="#">support</a> you financially and <a href="#">promote</a> you. It's in their interest. They make money and receive special awards based on your success.</p>
                    <p>Our video below explains the process in more detail. Or you can read through.</p>

                    <h4 class="subTitle">Crowdbass is an open platform, for any artist who meets our simple prerequisites. We want to find talent. Raw talent. Our barriers to entry are remarkably low.</h4>
                	<div class="whoApply">
                        <p>It is simple. Any artist can apply to Crowdbass. Any artist from any genre of music and from any background.</p>
                        <p>Before you apply, we have one simple prerequisite:</p>
                        <a href="#">You have a finished or nearly finished album recorded.</a>
                        <p>Why? Because Crowdbass is about raising Marketing budget. Money and a network to help you promote your album to the masses. We don't help bands raise money for recording.</p>
                        <h5 class="title">What Genre's of music?</h5>
                        <p>Any! We want a wide range of talent. Music in itself is diverse. We love cross-over. We are looking for artists who can challenge the known.</p>
                        <h5 class="title">We don't have a Manager / Distribution / Label / ANYTHING!</h5>
                        <p>No problem! We can help you out with all of that. If we think you've got what it takes, you will be paired with one of our world class music managers. The guy who found the Stereophonics? Robbie Williams' manager? Guys who have the contacts to make you a success. We can also sort out your distribution, registration. We can do it all. All we are interested in is finding great talent. And once we do, we will do everything we can to make you a success.</p>

                    <h3 class="mainHeading">HOW it Works</h3>
                    <h4 class="subTitle">When you get listed on Crowdbass, you are exposed to thousands of music fans around the UK, all looking to find the next big thing, all incentivised to make you a success.</h4>
                    <p>But before we get to that, we need to explain the process.</p>
                    <p>We select artists we think have a chance of making it. This is a decision made by some of the best A&amp;R Resources in the music industry along with our industry leading music managers.</p>
                    <p>So when you apply to Crowdbass, we listen extensively to your tracks.</p>
                    <p>If we feel you are the type of artist we are looking for, you get listed. We charge a £199 listing fee, which you need to pay up-front. We also take a 10% cut of the money raised.</p>
                    <p>You need to provide 5 incentives for people investing in you, and 10 for people promoting you. <a href="#">See some examples of incentives here.</a> We have huge lists of ideas, or you can think of your own. Obviously, the better and more unique the incentives, the more likely you are to incentivise fans to achieve them!</p>
                    <p>We then list you. Once listed, you go into the A&amp;R queue. This means every "Label" on Crowdbass gets a notification saying a new artist has been added. You get 1000's of reviews and some immediate support – after all, our fans are incentivised to listen to you, rate you, review you and support you early.</p>
                    <p>Once you've built up the army of fans, you help them promote you, far and wide. Each one incentivised, not only to help you achieve your funding target, but to receive money-cannot-buy-awards for doing it.</p>
                    <p>By the time your album launch comes around, you'll have potentially 1000 fans incentivised to back you, and the support of the Crowdbass community wanting to see you succeed.</p>
                    <p>And the best thing is, it is open to any artist. Even those without <a href="#">representation.</a></p>

                    <h3 class="mainHeading">REPRESENTATION</h3>
                    <h4 class="subTitle">Crowdbass is about finding real talent. We love everything from raw college bands through to experienced pros who've been there, done it. Fully represented? Fine. No representation? Fine!</h4>
                    <p>Of course, if you're experienced in the music industry, you'll know what this means. If you're new, say a college band, let us explain what we mean.</p>
                    <p>Making it in the music industry is a job. In order to effective, you need to be well represented. You need a manager, you need a distribution deal, you need an EAN number and lots of other things that help you be a success. Not only will it help you track album sales, you need to track radio plays, royalty payments…you need to get into the right line-ups, on the right TV shows, get the right PR, the right exposure. All of this, on top of writing and recording amazing music.</p>
                    <p>Representation is just that. The person or people who represent you in the music industry. Those who look after your needs and help make you a success. Deals with the admin, your books, pulls the right strings, knows who to speak to to get you on a solid line-up, that great support slot with an established band.</p>
                    <p>At Crowdbass, we can provide that full package. We provide you, not only with the chance to be represented, but the chance to be represented by some of the industry's top managers. People who can open doors. People who have seen the mistakes made and know how to avoid them.</p>
